### Basic Questions (10 Questions)

1. **What is Java?**
   - **Answer**: Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence, simplicity, and wide usage in various domains such as web development, mobile applications, and enterprise software.

2. **What is the JDK?**
   - **Answer**: The JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development kit used to develop Java applications. It includes tools like the Java compiler (`javac`), the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and various libraries and documentation.

3. **What is the JVM?**
   - **Answer**: The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a virtual machine that executes Java bytecode. It provides a runtime environment for Java programs, handling memory management, garbage collection, and platform independence.

4. **What is the difference between `==` and `.equals()` in Java?**
   - **Answer**: `==` is used to compare primitive data types or object references, checking if they refer to the same memory location. `.equals()` is a method used to compare the contents of objects, often overridden to provide custom comparison logic.

5. **What are the main principles of OOP?**
   - **Answer**: The main principles are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, which help in creating modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

6. **What is inheritance in Java?**
   - **Answer**: Inheritance is a mechanism in Java where a class (subclass) can inherit properties and behavior (methods) from another class (superclass). It promotes code reuse and supports the "is-a" relationship.

7. **What is polymorphism in Java?**
   - **Answer**: Polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. In Java, it can be achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).

8. **What is the `main()` method in Java?**
   - **Answer**: `main()` is the entry point method in Java programs. It is the first method called when a Java application starts, and it serves as the starting point for program execution.

9. **What are variables and data types in Java?**
   - **Answer**: Variables are containers used to store data, and data types specify the type of data that can be stored in a variable. Java supports primitive data types (e.g., int, boolean) and reference data types (e.g., String, arrays).

10. **What is a constructor in Java?**
    - **Answer**: A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects in Java. It has the same name as the class and is invoked automatically when an object of the class is created.

These questions cover fundamental concepts of Java programming and are suitable for a fresher starting their journey in Java development.
