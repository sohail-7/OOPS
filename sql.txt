Apologies for the oversight! Let's continue with the remaining questions:

### Basic Questions (continued):

6. **What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE?**
   - DELETE is a DML command used to remove rows from a table based on a condition, while TRUNCATE is a DDL command used to remove all rows from a table, resetting the table's identity and space allocation.

7. **What is a view in SQL?**
   - A view is a virtual table created by a SQL query. It behaves like a table but does not store data directly. Instead, it retrieves data dynamically from the underlying tables whenever it's queried.

8. **What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR data types?**
   - CHAR is a fixed-length character data type that stores a specified length of characters, padding with spaces if necessary, while VARCHAR is a variable-length character data type that stores a variable length of characters, up to a maximum specified length.

9. **What is a self join?**
   - A self join is a type of join where a table is joined with itself. It's often used when you want to compare rows within the same table, such as when you need to find hierarchical relationships or when you need to compare data across different time periods.

10. **What is the difference between a clustered index and a non-clustered index?**
    - A clustered index determines the physical order of data rows in a table based on the indexed column(s) and is stored with the data, while a non-clustered index is a separate structure that stores a sorted list of references to the table's data rows.

### Average Questions (continued):

11. **What is a transaction in SQL?**
    - A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work. It follows the ACID properties, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

12. **Explain the difference between a candidate key, a primary key, and a unique key.**
    - A candidate key is a column or set of columns that can uniquely identify a row in a table. A primary key is a candidate key chosen as the main unique identifier for a table, and a unique key is a constraint that ensures the uniqueness of values in a column or set of columns.

13. **What are correlated subqueries?**
    - Correlated subqueries are subqueries that reference columns from the outer query. They're evaluated once for each row processed by the outer query and can be used to filter or perform calculations based on values from the outer query.

14. **Explain the difference between an inner join and an outer join.**
    - An inner join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables being joined, while an outer join returns all rows from one or both tables being joined, with null values for unmatched rows.

15. **What is the purpose of the GROUP BY clause?**
    - The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values into summary rows, typically to perform aggregate functions such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, or MIN on each group.

### Important Questions (continued):

16. **What is the difference between a database and a schema?**
    - A database is a container that holds one or more schemas, tables, views, and other database objects, while a schema is a logical grouping of database objects owned by a specific user or role within the database.

17. **Explain the concept of normalization and its different forms.**
    - Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to minimize redundancy and dependency. It's typically divided into several normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, 5NF) that progressively eliminate different types of data redundancy.

18. **What is the purpose of the EXISTS and NOT EXISTS operators?**
    - The EXISTS and NOT EXISTS operators are used to test for the existence of rows returned by a subquery. EXISTS returns true if the subquery returns at least one row, while NOT EXISTS returns true if the subquery returns no rows.

19. **What is the difference between a scalar function and a table-valued function?**
    - A scalar function returns a single value based on the input parameters, while a table-valued function returns a result set (table) based on the input parameters.

20. **Explain the difference between optimistic and pessimistic locking.**
    - Optimistic locking assumes that conflicts between transactions are unlikely and allows multiple transactions to access and modify the same data concurrently until they commit. Pessimistic locking locks data as soon as it's read, preventing other transactions from modifying it until the lock is released.
   
These additional questions provide a more comprehensive coverage of SQL concepts and should help in assessing the candidate's proficiency in SQL. Let me know if you need further clarification on any of these questions!
